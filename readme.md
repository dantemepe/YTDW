This repo was made for a windows only project that downloads youtube vids, i also have this on my ts-programs repo but this is like a dedicated repo for it in case i decide to expand it further

 - - This repo uses ffmpeg integrated onto it all credits to ffmpeg for the files ffmpeg´s domain is https://ffmpeg.org/ - -
   btw i was unable to add the app icon on the top left of the windows on the .exe cuz of the fact that i can´t (wasn´t able to) bundle the .ico inside of the .exe file
